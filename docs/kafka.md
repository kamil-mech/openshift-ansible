# Apache Kafka
Install an Apache Kafka cluster via Helm chart. These instructions require that Helm is installed in the Openshift cluster.

## Install

Create a new project in the cluster:

```bash
oc new-project kafka --display-name="Apache Kakfa" --description="Apache Kafka cluster using Stateful Sets and Zookeper"
```

From the master run:
```bash
oc edit scc anyuid
```
and append to the file the following entries:
```bash
users:
  - system:serviceaccount:default:ci
  - system:serviceaccount:ci:default
  - system:serviceaccount:kafka:default
```
This is needed because the Kafka chart that we use define the `uid` and `guid` equals to `1000`. Openshift runs in a security context which doesn't allow to execute containers with root uid and in general a low uid.

Run locally:
```
helm repo add incubator http://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-charts-incubator
helm install --name kafka incubator/kafka â€”-namespace kafka
```
This will spin up an Apache Kafka cluster with Zookeeper ensembles running under the namespace `kafka`.

## Notes
- It is required that the app nodes are at least 3 and are distributed uniformely across the Availability Zones. If this condition is not met then such an error could appear:
```
No nodes are available that match all of the following predicates:: MatchInterPodAffinity (1), MatchNodeSelector (3), NoVolumeZoneConflict (4)
```
